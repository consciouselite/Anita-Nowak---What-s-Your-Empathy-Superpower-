    "heroJourney": "Anita Nowak's journey began with her own exploration of empathy as both a personal value and a potential catalyst for change. After 15 years of studying empathy through the lenses of neuroscience, positive psychology, leadership theory, and ancient wisdom, she developed her 'Purposeful Empathy' framework. Having experienced the transformative power of empathy in her own life and seeing its impact on organizations, she now dedicates herself to helping others harness this power. As an 'empathy evangelist,' Anita combines academic rigor with practical application, helping individuals and organizations move from disconnection to connection, and from confusion to clarity about how empathy can drive both personal growth and positive social change."
